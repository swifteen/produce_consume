   This is an illustration of how the the POSIX thread primitives
   can be used to program a pair of Producer and Consumer threads.
   Annotations are provided to explain semantics of the primitives.
   The producer thread reads from standard input and passes a line
   of text at a time to the consumer thread.  The consumer thread
   then prints out the line, shifted to upper case.  The two threads
   communicate through a shared buffer, using POSIX condition
   variables to synchronize, and a POSIX mutex to protect the
   shared data.

   The effect of this program is to wait for input from the 
   standard input.  After it has received some number of lines of
   input (between 1 and 4, depending on the thread scheduling policy)
   it will start producing lines of output.  It will produce one
   line of output for each line of input, but may not always strictly
   alternate between input and output (due to the buffer).
   The output lines should be the same as the input
   lines, except that all letters have been shifted to uppercase.
   To terminate the program enter a Control-d (ASCII EOT) character.

   The exact behavior will vary according to the thread scheduling
   policy that is in force.

   Warning:  The technique used here is only adequate for a single
   producer and a single consumer.  (What is the problem if we have
   more than one producer or consumer?)

/*
(1) pthread_mutex_lock() locks the specified mutex.
    It blocks until the mutex is available, and returns with the
    mutex locked.  It must NOT be called if the calling thread
    has previously locked the mutex and has not since unlocked it.

    In this case, the mutex being locked is the one protecting
    the shared buffer, sb.

(2) Pthread_cond_wait() atomically releases the
    the mutex (the buffer lock, in this case) if it blocks.
    The calling thread must already holding the specified mutex locked.
    It will not return until we have the mutex locked again.
    A special feature of this primitive is that it is subject to
    so-called "spurious wakeups".  Thus, one always must
    enclose it within what looks like a busy-wait loop, which
    checks the logical condition for which the thread is waiting,
    and calls pthread_cond_wait() again if the condition is not
    yet satisfied.

    In this case, the condition for which we wait is the buffer
    having at least one free slot.

(3) pthread_mutex_unlock() releases the specified mutex.
    It returns with the mutex unlocked.  It does not block.
    It may ONLY be called if the calling thread has previously
    locked the mutex and has not since unlocked it.

(4) phread_cond_signal() signals any thread that
    is waiting on the specified condition variable.  If there is
    no thread waiting, the signal is lost.  If there is more than
    one thread waiting, at least one will wake up.  It is possible
    that other threads may also wake up --- one of the ways 
    spurious wakeups may occur, as mentioned above.

(5) Pthread_exit() causes the calling thread to terminate.
    
    In this case, the reason for termination is that we have detected
    an end-of-file condition.

|   void * (void *arg);

    That is, it has a single parameter, which must be of some pointer type.
    The formal return type is void *.

    In this case, we pass the address of the shared buffer
    as the parameter, and ignore the return value.

(2) pthread_join causes the caller to block until the specified
    thread has terminated.

    In this case, we use it to wait until the producer and consumer
    have terminated.  We could probably have just waited for the
    consumer to terminate, since we expect the producer to terminate
    first.

(3) pthread_detach allows the system resources (e.g. runtime stack space)
    associated with the specified thread to be returned to the system.

    In this case, we could probably skip it, since we are ready to
    shut down the whole process anyway.  In other situations it is
    more important.
